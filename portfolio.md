### 🔹 Senior Full Stack Engineer
**Woolworths (via TCS)** | *Bella Vista, NSW*    
📅 *Jun 2016 – Mar 2022*  
**Projects**: Store Central 2.0, Food Diversion, Action Center  
> #### Store Central 2.0
> Store Central is the core platform that “runs the
> stores” across the Woolworths group. Store Central
> 2.0 is the modernization program to revamp the
> existing platform to move to a modern technology
> stack and distribute some of the workload onto the
> Azure Cloud. The program involves the design of a
> responsive micro frontend application that renders in
> all desktop, mobile, and tablet devices, and a
> microservices-based backend
> #### Food Diversion
> A groundbreaking Australian first project that hooks
> into inventory flow to help prevent food waste and
> 100% food diversion away from landfills. This project
> developed a capability that identifies wastage in
> inventory movement across 2000+ stores in real-time
> and diverts that stock to charity organizations. The
> charity organizations get electronically notified about
> food pickup at their local store thereby ensuring food is
> diverted to the needy rather than into landfill
> #### Action Center
> The main intent of the Action Centre project is to
> develop a capability to streamline and deliver store
> staff across 2000+ Woolworths stores with real-time
> actionable alerts throughout the day via a mobile app.
> Alerts were generated by multiple algorithms that sift
> through large volumes of data and alerts must reach
> the stores almost instantly to maximize the benefit.
> This project was a game changer for productivity
> across the group and was designed with extensive
> integration points and leveraging native cloud-based
> notification processing technologies.
> #### Application Hardening
> Building CICD pipeline for all applications that come
> under Stores umbrella
